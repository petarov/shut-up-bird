  * An annual archive of your twitter activty.
  * Setup a cron job to regularly clean up your status.

A Twitter authentication request page should automatically open in your browser. If not or if you're running this on a server, open the url generated below in your browser.

    Authenticating ...please wait
    Opening url - https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=<token>

That's it. You're ready to go. :ok_hand:

# Usage

Archive all of your tweets until `Dec 31, 2014` and then delete them from Twitter. Tweets will be saved in ascending date order. Verbose logs will be displayed.

    python shut-up-bird.py -v --max-date "2014-12-31" --asc --remove 

Archive all of your likes until `Dec 31, 2014` and then delete them from Twitter. Likes will be saved in ascending date order. Verbose logs will be displayed.

    python shut-up-bird.py -v --likes --max-date "2014-12-31" --asc --remove

Archive all of your tweets posted before the tweet with id `123456789012345678`. Tweets will be saved in descending date order. No tweets will be deleted.

    python shut-up-bird.py -v -id 123456789012345678

The same as above but skips all replies and retweets.

    python shut-up-bird.py -v -id 123456789012345678 -rt -re

Generated `epub` files are found in the sub folder `./shut-up-bird.arch`, e.g., `./shut-up-bird.arch/2017-03-05_1000/tweets.epub`.

Note that you must explicitly specify the `--remove` parameter in order to delete tweets or likes. To prevent inconsistencies, tweets or likes will be deleted only after an `epub` file was successfully created first.
